Change Log Version 1.5:
----------------------

Minor modifications were made focusing primarily on cleaning up code and improving visuals slightly. Some minor functionality
improvements were also made.

Changes include:
  - Changed font color of locked parameter and Vin by toggling textfield locked status instead of enable.
  - Adjusted connection Diagram to account for ground connection.
  
  - General cleanup of code commenting, removing unneeded sections.
  
  - Display warning when input max range is set to greater than 600V 
	- Fixed error where DC voltage could be set by setting an initial frequency and then changing it by applying 0Hz. 
    Warning messgae will now be displayed if 0Hz is applied and frequency will revert to last usable frequency.
