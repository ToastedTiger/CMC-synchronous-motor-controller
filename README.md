# CMC-synchronous-motor-controller
Version 1.50

Application to control synchronous motor written in Visual Basics for Application (VBA).

Project done on behalf of Alectrix (Pty) Ltd for Client Sasol

Description:
Application Takes a DCV reading on binary channel 1. It will then then output 3-phase voltage and current on VA and IA channels 
respectively at preset Amplitudes, frequency and phase angle (current relative to voltage). 
One output parameter will be selected to to be dependent on the DCV input based on a linear model of the min and max ranges.

Machine compatibility:
OMICRON CMC 256plus
OMICRON CMC 256-6
OMICRON CMC 356
OMICRON CMC 430 (not verified)
