# CMC-synchronous-motor-controller
Application to control synchronous motor written in Visual Basics for Application (VBA).

Description:
Application Takes a DCV reading on binary channel 1. It will then then output 3-phase voltage and current on VA and IA channels 
respectively at preset Amplitudes, frequency and phase angle (current relative to voltage). 
One output parameter will be selected to to be dependent on the DCV input based on a linear model of the min and max ranges.

Machine compatibility:
CMC 256plus
CMC 256-6
CMC 356
CMC 430 (not verified)
